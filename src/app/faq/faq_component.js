    },
    {
      question: "What payment schedule do you use?",
      answer:
        "Your invoice confirms due dates. If a payment is not received on time, we may cancel services per our Terms.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is included in your proposals?",
      answer:
        "Clear scope, inclusions, and an itemised price. Typical inclusions are producer time, venue sourcing (if requested), supplier bookings, run sheet, and on-day coordination. Optional extras (e.g., live streaming, custom fabrication) are listed separately.",
    },

      question: "Do you work outside the Gold Coast?",

    {
      question: "What is your cancellation policy?",
      answer:
        "Within 48 hours of the event: no refund. More than 2 days out: you may be eligible for a partial refund (the deposit is non-refundable). All third-party supplier policies flow through to you and will be clarified at time of booking.",
    },
    {
      question: "Who is responsible for guest behaviour and safety?",

  Permits: [
    {
      question: "Do you find and book the venue?",
      answer:
        "Yes—our Venue Sourcing service shortlists 3 to 6 options with specs, floor plans and indicative pricing. We arrange site visits, date holds and handle contracting once you approve.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do beach or public-space events need permits?",
      answer:
        "Some locations require council or foreshore permits. We will advise and apply where relevant, and we will build a Plan B for weather.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can you work in private homes or Airbnbs?",

  Catering: [
    {
      question: "What catering styles do you offer?",

      question: "Do you do BYO bars?",
